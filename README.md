# Personal Website — Lewis Kimari

This is the source for Lewis Kimari's personal portfolio website.

## Deployment
This repository contains a static site. Deploy using Vercel (recommended) or another static host. For local testing, run `npm start` to serve the site using `live-server`.

Vercel quick steps:
1. Go to https://vercel.com, sign in with your GitHub account and import this repository.
2. Set Framework Preset to "Other" or "Static Site", leave Build Command blank, and set the Output Directory to `/` (root).
3. Deploy — Vercel will provide a `vercel.app` domain. To add a custom domain, go to the project Settings → Domains and follow the DNS instructions Vercel shows (usually a CNAME to `cname.vercel-dns.com` for `www`).
